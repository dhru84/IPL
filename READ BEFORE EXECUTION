after placing all these 5 files in ur folder in the order - 

medicine quality-folder/
├── public-folder(inside the medicine quality-folder)/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── form.html
│   ├── results.html
│   └── style.css
└── server.js

open terminal in ur vs code and execute this command - npm init -y
the execute this command - npm install express body-parser
to run the file use the command - node server.js (use this command every time u want to run)

(due to some error, if u try running the file by clicking go live in index.html u won't get output of the result page hence don't try that)

everytime u want to execute type command - node server.js

contact Dhruthi incase of any issues

bye~
